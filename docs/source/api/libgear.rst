==========================
.. py::currentmodule:: libgear
Trajectory storage and management/selection are abstracted as storage space allocation/deallocation and indices management/selection in GEAR, which means the storage space(:py:class:`libgear.storage.TrajectoryTable`.) and the status table of indices(for example :py:class:`libgear.index.Indexset`.) are decoupled.
