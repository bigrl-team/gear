# Multi-Agent-Transformer
The model implementations and several utility codes under this folder are directly adapted from the [official repo](https://github.com/PKU-MARL/Multi-Agent-Transformer) of Multi-Agent-Transformer(MAT). MAT is a state-of-the-art neural network that employs an encoder-decoder architecture to model multi-agent learning problems as sequence modeling tasks. Its novel approach has been prized the SOTA results in multiple multi-agent tasks. If you're interested in learning more about the MAT model, please visit their official repository."
